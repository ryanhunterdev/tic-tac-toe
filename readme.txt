Tic Tac Toe Game by Ryan Hunter

https://ryanhunterdev.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

TIC-TAC-TOE 950xl is a classic noughts and crosses game with a 90's sampler/drum machine twist. 

The UI is style is inspired by the AKAI s950 and MPC2000xl, two classic pieces of music hardware, both highly lauded in the hip hop and dance music communities.

The sound efffects are all taken from 90's Jungle music.

Further features I would like to add is a slider or rotary knob for the volume, the possibility to switch between different sound sets, and an option to play the computer with a score tally.

Technologies used are standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
